## Repository Description

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. It serves as a personal collection of algorithms and data structure implementations to track my progress and share my approach to solving coding challenges.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
leetcode-solutions/
├── easy/                  # Easy difficulty problems
├── medium/                # Medium difficulty problems
├── hard/                  # Hard difficulty problems
└── topics/                # Solutions organized by topic
    ├── arrays/
    ├── strings/
    ├── linked-lists/
    ├── trees/
    ├── dynamic-programming/
    ├── graphs/
    └── ...
```

Each problem solution includes:
- A source code file with the solution
- A brief explanation of the approach
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Edge cases considered

## How to Navigate

You can navigate this repository in multiple ways:

1. **By Difficulty**: Browse the `easy/`, `medium/`, and `hard/` directories
2. **By Topic**: Check out the `topics/` directory to find solutions grouped by data structure or algorithm type
3. **By Problem Number**: Each solution file is prefixed with its LeetCode problem number (e.g., `0001-two-sum.py`)

## Solving Approach

My general approach to solving these problems:

1. **Understand the problem** thoroughly before attempting a solution
2. **Start with a brute force approach** to establish a baseline
3. **Optimize the solution** by analyzing time and space complexity
4. **Test with different inputs**, especially edge cases
5. **Document the approach** for future reference

I try to provide multiple solutions when applicable, showing the progression from naive approaches to optimized ones.

## License

This repository is for educational purposes. Feel free to reference these solutions, but I encourage you to understand the problems and develop your own solutions first.

Happy coding!
